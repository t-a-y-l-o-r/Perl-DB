# Perl-DB
SimpleDB.pl is a basic example of a SDBM type data base in perl5.


o will list all options 
r will read the value after accepting a key
l will list all elements
w will add an element
d will delete an element
x will DESTROY EVERYTHING PREPARE TO CRY
q will quit the script



There is nothing special about this database and it should not be considered secure for any reason.
